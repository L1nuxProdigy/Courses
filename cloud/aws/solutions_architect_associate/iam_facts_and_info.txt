* Only attached policies effect identites and resources
* Deny/ Allow hierarchy:
    Explicit deny overrule all and will deny access
    Explicit allow will allow access and "wins" default implicit deny
    Default implicit deny is assumed if no other explicit policy was attached and will deny access
    ** AWS will evaluate all policies and will decide what an identity/ resource may do based on the hierarchy
* Managed policies can be created in the policeis section and be attached to many identities/ resources
    AWS managed policies are less overhead but less flexibility
    Customer managed policies are more overhead with more flexibility
* Inline policies are directly under the identity/ resource and help to add exceptions to the managed policeis
    allow more access to resources
    add explicit denies to limit resource access

* 5000 limit of IAM users
* IAM user can be a member of up to 10 groups
* IAM user can be associated with up to 10 managed policies (can eb changed with support allegedly)
* IAM user can be associated with as many inline policies as possible under the restriction of maximum 2048 characters of all the policies All together
* 1 MFA per IAM user
* 2 access keys per IAM user


* groups in AWS are administrative constructs to attach policies to that basically flow into thier members
  and group IAM users but they are not "true" identites in the sense they cannot be referenced to from resource policeis
